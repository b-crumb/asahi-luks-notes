## asahi-notes

What you mind find useful from this repository, in which I am storing my notes on this distro, is:

1. An Asahi LUKS guide.
2. My apparmor.d Asahi patches.

The **LATEST AND "STABLE"** version is [DECEMBER 2022](./December%202022/notes.md)

You can also check out my [`asahi-infra`](https://github.com/b-crumb/asahi-infra) repo for anything which I am building manually.
